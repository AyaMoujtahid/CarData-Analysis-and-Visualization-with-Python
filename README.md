## Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail transaction data. Through the analysis, key insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity are derived. This analysis can be used to guide business decisions by providing a better understanding of the data, as well as identifying trends and anomalies.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes retail transactions with the following attributes:
- **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number for each transaction.
- **StockCode**: Product code.
- **Description**: Product description.
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for the customer.
- **Country**: Country of the customer.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and invalid data entries.
- **Sales Calculation**: Deriving total sales from quantity and unit price.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Visualizing monthly sales trends over time.
- **Top-Selling Products & Countries**: Identifying top products by quantity sold and top countries by total sales.
- **Outlier Detection**: Using boxplots to detect sales anomalies.
- **Visualizations**: Utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful charts like histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots.
